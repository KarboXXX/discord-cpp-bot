## üñ•Ô∏è About
- This project is owned by [@KarboXXX](https://github.com/KarboXXX).
- This project is still being made, i'll also add language support for Portuguese where it does not exist, even though it's my native language.
- I'm not recommending you to use C++ to code a Discord bot, instead of NodeJS or Python. This is just a project i'm doing for fun, and to practice more about C++.

## üìö Libraries & dependencies
- [DPP](https://dpp.dev)

## üèóÔ∏è Bulding
- First install the project dependency from the official website, for your current platform. Note that you can also install it using VCPKG, using `vcpkg install dpp:x64-windows` (replace `x64-windows` with whatever operational system you're building for.)
- After that, clone the repository running `git clone KarboXXX/discord-cpp-bot` (note that you'll need Git installed on your machine.)
- - To install Git on Linux for Debian derivatives, run `sudo apt-get install git`
- - On Windows 10/11 you'll need to search for the official release, if you don't have **winget**.
- Then, on the project root folder, run `make`. If it's not your first time compiling, and you've changed the source code, and just want to run it right after compiling, you can run `make recompile` to automate this process. If you prefer a better performing version of the compiled project, in exchange for extra build time, you can run `make effective-build`
